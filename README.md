Answers:

1) The algorithm uses a for loop to crack the password, increasing the number until we get the password correct
2) with a brute force loop of any type
3) There are more characters in the password
4) Use characters, letters, and numbers so it is harder for a brute force attack
5) We changed the characters into asl to make them able to be read and used in a loop
6) It added an extra set of characters that did not match our old system, so we had to change the code
7) Strong passwords are harder for an algorithm to go through every character to crack the password
final
1)longer passwords with multiple different characters
2) Companies should use 2 step authentication so that the password is not the only thing that protects them
